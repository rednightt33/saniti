## 2026-09-06

### GitHub tracking contract established

- Added mandatory AI read order and same-task GitHub update rules.
- Added separate database and Railway changelogs.
- Added forward-only SQL migrations for database schema history.
- Imported the current project as a secret-safe `.railway/railway.ts` snapshot.
- Extended the daily GitHub Action to capture Railway configuration drift and database schema changes.
- Kept live secrets and raw production data outside GitHub.

### PostgreSQL daily-price table

- Loaded 668,967 daily price rows into the PostgreSQL service in environment `dev`.
- Renamed the table to `Price_Stock_Indonesia_IDX` for the requested capitalization.
- No Railway service, deployment, domain, or environment-variable values changed.

### Broker-summary supervisor

- A local Windows supervisor was introduced for the Stockbit backfill.
- This is a process on the user's PC, not a Railway service or deployment.
- It resumes incomplete dates and recreates the temporary PostgreSQL TCP proxy after connection failure.

### Broker-summary authentication recovery

- Replaced the expired Stockbit session credential in the local Windows supervisor; no credential value was committed.
- Restarted the supervisor and preserved all dates already marked `COMPLETED`.
- Confirmed the existing Railway PostgreSQL TCP proxy and database connection remained healthy.
- Verified automatic recovery from the earliest `NEEDS_REVIEW` date before allowing the backfill to continue.
- No Railway service, deployment, domain, or environment-variable values changed.
